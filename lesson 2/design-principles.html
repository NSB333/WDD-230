        <p class = "normalText floatLeft">The Fit Foodie page utilizes Hick's Law by presenting four favorable options right from the start. They offer Breakfast, Casserole, Sweets, and Soups options right from the start. That in of itself covers many different food types that the user may be interested in, but below it they also have more specific choices. They make the choices popular things that people may be looking for. For example they straight up have options for chicken and pork, but not beef. The reason is because this is a health food website, so they would choose 'healthier' meat like pork and chicken over beef.</p>

        <h3><a href = "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng" target = "_blank">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a></h3>
        <img class = "smallPadding" src = "C:\school\Winter 2023\Web Frontend Developement\Week 1\WDD-230\images\Church Website.png", alt = "Church of Jesus Christ Site Page">
        <p class = "normalText">Between each of the images listed there is a nice thick white border around each of the images. This helps the screen feel full while not feeling overwhelming. The spacing with the text at the bottom of the screen is also very helpful. There are ten items listed there, but I can read each one easily because of the spacing and I'm not likely to look over any of them.</p>

        <p class="normalText">The use of bright colors contrast the black background and make it easier to read. The bright red color also does well against the black background while also contrasting greatly with the white. That is the reason the title looks so good with the white text with the bright red outlines to contrast the black.</p>
